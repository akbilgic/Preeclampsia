The available code and five-fold cross-validated models, zipped, are for ECG-AI prediction of preeclampsia using raw 10secong 12 Lead ECGs. 

See requirements.txt file for required python packages.

The .py file loads the metadata which contains the ECG file name (saved as a .npy) and removes the first second of the ECGs. The provided code will allow loading of the .h5 models and produce predictions.
